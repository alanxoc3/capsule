# Mario and guns.
I remember playing Rock paper as a kid with my brothers. We used modified rules
though. You can use a gun. Gun can shoot anything, so it can defeat anything.
Also you can use
Mario. Mario can jump on anything, so Mario beats everything as well. The
person who accepts to play the game will usually be the only one who would use
one of these secret moves, because that person is the one who actually doesn't
want to play the game.

So the next time someone asks if you want to play this simple game, you can use
one of these secret moves. "Rock paper scissors, Mario!"

# 石头剪刀布.
One semester, while a Sophomore in university, I had a Taiwanese roommate. At
the time, I knew nothing about Mandarin. I asked him if he could tell me how to
say "Do you want to play Rock Paper Scissors with me?" He recorded his voice,
"你想和我一起玩石头剪刀布吗". I knew nothing about Chinese, but I started
practicing how to say this simple sentence every day, because I thought I might
meet a Chinese person that I could impress one day.

A month and a half later, I finally had a conversation with a Chinese
classmate. I was really excited that I could use this sentence to impress
someone. When I asked the girl, "Do you want to play Rock-Paper-Scissors?", she
didn't understand me.

Then I had to explain what I wanted to ask in English. I felt defeated. After
such a long time of daily study, I still could not pronounce the sentence
correctly.
