I've spent a lot of time thinking about creating a good flashcard application.
I want to formalize the process of my thoughts.

# Concards Version 1
```
* Group
** Subsection
*** Further subsection.
*** More detail.
**** Even more detail.
** Etc...
* Another Group
```

# Concards Version 2
My first thought about 5 years ago was structuring ideas as an outline format.

```
# Group
+ Subsection
 -Further subsection.
 -More detail.
 =Even more detail.
+ Etc...
# Another Group
```

My idea was to create an outline/flashcard program eventually.

# Concards Version 3
I changed my idea later to more closely resemble flashcards. My idea was that
flashcards have a group and

```
## group
Pikachu
	A Pokemon I think.
~~ 19-5-2017@12:21, 0, 2.50
```

# Concards Version 4
## group
Pikachu
	A Pokemon I think.
~~ 19-5-2017@12:21, 0, 2.50
```
