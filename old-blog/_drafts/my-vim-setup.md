For the past 6 years, most of the time I spend on my computer involves using
Vim. Vim is pretty amazing, because of the modal editing approach, a person can
edit documents much faster than a traditional IDE or text editor. This post
isn't an introduction to Vim, but rather a collection of things that makes my
Vim setup a bit unique.

# Neovim
Okay, I don't actually use [Vim](https://www.vim.org/) anymore, I use
[Neovim](https://neovim.io/)! Neovim is just newer and cooler than vim. All
you have to do is compare the two homepages to see what I mean :). As far as I
know, Neovim supports everything Vim supports, but more! (I actually don't know
what I mean by more, I just like it 'cause it's new :).
