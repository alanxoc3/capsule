Security teacher. Wanted to prank. Spent a few weeks, with freetime. Finally
found loophole and put something together. Had a pretty foolproof plan, but I
didn't actually hate the person, so told teacher in charge of Linux SSH
servers. Spent 2 hours trying to figure out how to fix. Returned home and
figured it out for him later that night.
