you clicked on a link that is supposed to take you to an external gemini
capsule, but you aren't using a gemini client (basically a web browser for
gemini capsules). if you want to continue, you need to use one. this is the
client list from the official gemini website. it only lists some of the popular
clients. try these links:
=> https://gemini.circumlunar.space/clients.html      popular gemini clients
=> https://github.com/kr1sp1n/awesome-gemini          gemini clients, servers, tools, & more
