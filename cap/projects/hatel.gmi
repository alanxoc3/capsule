# hatel
Hatel is a program & keyboard layout that uses midi input to generate keystrokes. Currently I have all the basic latin letters defined as well as a few punctuation type things. I'm the only user right now and I'm still practicing this layout. Once I can type all the letters at a decent speed, I will spec out numbers & symbols.

You can see find the code on github:
