#- crito

i read crito by plato earlier this year. here is what i wrote about it then.

socrates brought up the same question to crito two times. should we care about the opinion of the many? or should we care about the opinion of good men? socrates related this to a gymnastic coach. if you want to improve, should you listen to your coach, or other people who do not know your situation as well? socrates believes that you should listen to your coach.

the internet makes it easier to listen to people who lack expertise or authority. it's too easy to try to find an answer you like instead of an answer that's correct. i need to give more attention to the various "coaches" i have in my life.
