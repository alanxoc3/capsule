i read the apology by plato at the beginning of this year. here's what i wrote about it at that time:

in the apology, socrates said that he went to the various different people to see if they were wise. master poets wrote beautiful poetry, but when asked why they wrote something, they couldn't help but brag about themselves. master artisans knew many things that socrates was ignorant of, because they had mastery in one area, they thought they understood many things that were higher than them though. unfortunately, i am sometimes like the master poets and artisans and fail to realize that i don't actually know that much.
