#- save the bird

i helped make a game for ludum dare #46. you are a quadcopter that sees a bird fly off into danger, so you must save it. your quadcopter friends think you've gone crazy, so they chase you. i made this game with a random dude from the uk who was looking for someone to help with music. i ended up contributing a bunch of ideas, all the music, and maybe 1/4 of the code. this was my first ludum dare entry, so it was exciting.
