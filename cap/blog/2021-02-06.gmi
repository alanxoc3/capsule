#- candle rain

i made a game for the one hour game jam #302. keep the candle safe from rain by staying underneath the umbrella. for this entry, i think i did pretty good with the sprites. the rain doesn't look good though and the song is too annoying. i got feedback that the gameplay is good. also, there is a secret if you can get your score above 100. play it here:
