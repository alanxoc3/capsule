#- hey there kitty

i made a game for the 4 hour game jam. my brother made the sprites and i spent all my time trying to make the game really smooth. in the end, there wasn't actually much gameplay, but the game looks like it could be really good. it's just about a kitty that jumps around, while you read the story. you can jump around as a kitty here:
